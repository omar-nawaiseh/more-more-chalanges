                <h2>Alakazam </h2>
                <p>Alakazam is a Pok√©mon characterized by its humanoid structure and large mustache. A female Alakazam
                    has a significantly shorter mustache than a male. It has a long, thin snout, narrow eyes, ear-like
                    spikes extending from the top of its head, and an additional spike protruding from each cheek.
                    Covering its yellow, skeletal body are brown armor-like sections over its chest, shoulders,
                    forearms, and knees. There are three toes on each foot, each of which has a white claw. Two of the
                    toes face forward, while one faces backwards. It wields a silver spoon in each hand, which act as
                    amplifiers for its psychic abilities. The spoons are created using its psychic powers and it may
                    give one to someone it trusts. Alakazam is able to lower the accuracy of its opponents by bending
                    the spoons it wields, using its signature move Kinesis.

                    As Mega Alakazam, its mustache turns white and becomes longer and bushier. It also grows a long,
                    white beard. The armor-like sections become bulkier, and its upper body section becomes slightly
                    shorter to reveal its thin stomach. The ear-like spikes become slightly shorter and a larger spike
                    forms on top of its head. Additionally, it gains an oval, red organ in the center of its forehead.
                    The organ is said to emit psychic power. Its lower legs become longer and slimmer and its feet
                    become skinnier and resemble talons. It gains three additional spoons, for a total of five that it
                    levitates in the air. At the cost of its already-low muscular strength, Mega Alakazam's power is
                    entirely converted to pure psychic energy. It can read the course of a person's entire life with a
                    single glance.

                    Alakazam is able to use all forms of psychic abilities. The overflow of its psychic powers can cause
                    headaches to those nearby. These powers are used to move its body, as opposed to its weak muscles.
                    It also uses its psychic powers to hold up its head, which is too heavy to be supported by its neck.
                    Due to its continually growing brain, its head becomes larger with age. It is said to have an
                    excellent memory and can remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, to
                    the time of its death, and has an IQ that exceeds 5,000. It is found in urban areas.</p>
